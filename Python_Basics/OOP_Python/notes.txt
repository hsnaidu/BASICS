: Object Oriented Programming 
    -> Concept focus on REUSBALE CODE (DRY CODE)

    -> You solve a problem by creating an Object

: There are basically 2 ways you solve a coding problem 
    1. Function Approach
    2. OOPS Approach - Most used 


The Object Oriented Programming has 2 Major Things

1. CLASS -> A Blueprint consisting multiple OBJECTS
2. OBJECTS (Instance of a Class) -> Functions

-> CONSIDER CLASS IS A FORM
    -> FORM HAS MULTIPLE AREA TO BE FILLER THOSE ARE CLASSES

Ex: You are filling a FORM for IPS

    -> Form will be under your NAME
        -- > CLASS : Your_Name
    
    ---> Form will also have multiple sub area to be filled

    -> Age, Ph-no, Address, etc..
        -- > OBJECTS : Age, Ph-no etc..

-- SO YOU CREATE A FORM (TEMPLATE) THEY ARE USED MY MANY --

A Object of a given class can invoke the menthods, available to users without revealing the implementation details : ABSTRACTION & ENCAPSULATION

 
NOTE : INSTANCE ATTRIBUTE TAKES PREFERENCE OVER CLASS ATTRIBUTE


1. SELF -> We use self to make the code aware about its ATTRIBUTE
2. @staticmethod -> We use it if any method in the class has no use of the self Object

3. __init__ constructor -> They are the first thing that run as soon as the object is created




: INHERITANCE 

You have concept of BASE CLASS & INHERITED CLASS

-> Inherited Class are derived for Base Class
