: FUNCTIONS AND RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
    -> They are a block of code 
    -> They can be called n number of times 

-> If you are writing a code more than two times make it a FUNCTION


syntax : 
        -> def my_function_name(argument):
                # code ..
                return 0
            my_function_name(argument)


: Difference btw normal funciton and a return funciton

        -> def function_one(number):
                print(number)

                # This function output can just be used to display but the output produced cannot be used by another function or code

        -> function_two(number):
                return number
            
                # I can use this function output to store in a variable or another calculations

                var_name = function_two(argument)
                var_name += 10
