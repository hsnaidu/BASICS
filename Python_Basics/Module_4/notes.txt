DICTIONARY & SETS [Data Structures]

: DICTIONARY are set of Key Value Pair
    -> They are given by {}
    -> They key can be of int,flaot or string datatype
    -> They are mutable and You cannot do indexing 
    -> You cannot have duplicates

---  INSTEAD OF INDEXING YOU CAN GIVE THE KEY NAME ---

    -> You can creat a null dictionary : info = {}
    -> You can alos create a nested-dictionary

    -> To access the key of a nested dictionary by : Adding one more []
    -> print(info['hobbies']['music'])

METHODS IN DICTIONARY
    1. dict.keys() - Shows all the keys
    2. dict.values() - Shows all the values of key
    3. dict.items() - Shows all key value pair as tuples
    4. dict.get("key") - Returns the key according to value
    5. dict.update(newDict) - They are used to update a new key-value pair

: SETS - They are a collection of the unordered items 
    -> Each Element in the set must be UNIQUE and IMMUTABLE 
    -> They are immutable
