-> LIST AND TUPLES

: LISTS are MUTABLE (You can change anything in btw) 
    -> LIST (Array) DATASTRUCTURE
    -> They store a set of values 
    -> You can store a data elements of different datatype
    -> Denoted by []

LIST AND TUPLES FOLLOW SAME STRUCTURE AS A STRING 

1. INDEXING 
        -> list[0]
2. LENGTH
        -> len(list)
3. APPEND
        -> marks.append(20) # Add's Element at LAST
4. SORT
        -> marks.sort() # Sort's the Element 
        -> marks.sort(reverse = True)
5. REVERSE 
        -> Reverse the entire list
6. INSERT 
        -> Insert a particular element at an index 
7. REMOVE
        -> Remove an element in the list 
8. POP
        -> Remove element at index (Similar to INSERT)
9. COUNT
        -> Count the number of element occurance 


: TUPLES are IMMUTABLE (You cannot change anything in btw)
        -> They are similar to LIST
        -> Denoted by ()

They have two important methods 

1. INDEX 
        -> marks.index(element) : Returns the elemtn index

2. COUNT 
        -> marks.count(element)
