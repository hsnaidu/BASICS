DICTIONARY & SETS [Data Structures]

: DICTIONARY are set of Key Value Pair
    -> They are given by {}
    -> They key can be of int,flaot or string datatype
    -> They are mutable and You cannot do indexing 
    -> You cannot have duplicates

---  INSTEAD OF INDEXING YOU CAN GIVE THE KEY NAME ---

    -> You can creat a null dictionary : info = {}
    -> You can alos create a nested-dictionary

    -> To access the key of a nested dictionary by : Adding one more []
    -> print(info['hobbies']['music'])

METHODS IN DICTIONARY
    1. dict.keys() - Shows all the keys
    2. dict.values() - Shows all the values of key
    3. dict.items() - Shows all key value pair as tuples
    4. dict.get("key") - Returns the key according to value
    5. dict.update(newDict) - They are used to update a new key-value pair

: SETS - They are a collection of the unordered items 
    -> Each Element in the set must be UNIQUE and MUTABLE
    -> But their elements are immutable meaning we cannot the same duplicates values 

    -> YOU CANNOT STORE A LIST AND A DICTIONARY INSIDE A SETS

-> DEFINING AN EMPTY SET : collection = set ()

: SET HAVE DIFFERENT COLLECTION 
    -> 1. set.add() : They are used for adding an alement 
    -> 2. set.remove(element) : They are used for removing an element
    -> 3. set.clear() # Clears the entire set 
    -> 4. set.pop() # Removes a value RANDOMLY

    -> set.union(set2) : Combines both set-values and Returns new 
    -> set.intersection(set2) : Combines common values and returns a new set
