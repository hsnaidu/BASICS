Introduction to Python *(Guido van Rossum)

1. CODE : LANGUAGE -> PASS INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPUTER (Programming Language- > Python)

2. Takes i/p in Binary Code (Numbers : 0 or 1)
            -> 0 : Low current 
            -> 1 : High current 

3.  So, what ever we type is translated into Binary Language (0 & 1) with the help of 
    -> COMPILER / INTERPRETER
    -> CONVERT HIGH LVL LANG -TO- LOW LVL LANG

4. WHY PYTHON ? 

    -> SIMPLE & EASY (Similar to English Language)
    -> FREE & OPEN SOURCE
    -> HIGH LVL LANG
    -> PORTABLE  

5. They are used in almost Every-Domain

6. simple code : print('hello')

7. Python can process all ASCII and Unicode (ord) characters as part of data or literals

8. VARIABLE -> THEY ARE A NAME GIVEN TO A MEMORY LOCATION IN PROGRAM 

    8.1 RULES FOR IDENTIFIER (VARIABLE NAME)
        -> YOU CAN ONLY USE A _ IN VARIABLE NAME 
        -> CANNOT USE A INT AS A VARIABLE NAME 
        -> THEY CAN BE OF ANY LENGTH

9. PYTHON HAS 5 DATATYPES
    -> INT, STRING, FLOAT, BOOLEAN, NONE
    
10. PYTHON HAS A LIST OF RSERVED WORDS, WHICH CANNOT BE USED AS A VARIABLE NAME 

11. THEY ARE CASE SENSETIVE
        -> A & a are different
