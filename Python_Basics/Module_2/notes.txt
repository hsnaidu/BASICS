1. STRINGS 
    -> DATATYPE - THEY STORE A SEQUENCE OF CHARACTER WITHIN " "
        -> "hello world" , 'hello world' , """hello world"""

2. ESCAPE SEQUENCE
    -> \n : Next Line

3. OPERATION OF STRINGS
    -> 1. CONCATINATION : Adding two strings 
        -> "hello" + "world" = "hello world"
    
    -> 2. LENGTH : len()
        -> len('hello') -> 5

    -> 3. INDEXING : ACCESSED BY USIGN []
        -> Each CHARACTER is given a POSITION (number) you can access with number, FROM 0 to n-1
        -> word = "hello" -> word[0] -> h
            -> Couts space and special_char
    
    -> 4. SLICING 
        -> They are used to take subset of a word 
        -> word[0:3] -> hel -> 3 is leftout 
        
            -> PYTHON ALSO SUPPORTS -ve INDEXING 
        -> word[::-1] -> Used to print INVERSE : Better used for palindrome 
    
    -> There are many STRING functions, used for a specific cases  

4. CONDITIONAL STATEMENT
    -> if, elif, else
    -> YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE IF, ELIF STATEMENT'S IN THE CODE 
    -> They are mainly used to execute the code based on CONDITION

    -> ALSO A CONCEPT OF TERNERY OPERATION : A VERY SIMPLE IF-ELSE STATEMENT
