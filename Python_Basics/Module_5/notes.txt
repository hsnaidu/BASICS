: LOOPS

    -> Loops are used to repeat instructions.

THEY ARE OF TWO TYPES ( FOR & WHILE )

1. WHILE 

    while condition:
        # perform some work

2. FOR

    for condition:
        # perform some work

# SYNTAX

i = 1       # Itterator
while i <= 10:
    print('hello')      # Itteration
    i+=1

3. BREAK & CONTINUE 

    -> Break basically halts the execution if condition is true 

    -> Continue basically continues the execution if the condition is true

: FOR LOOPS ARE GENERALLY USED FOR SEQUENTIAL TRAVERSAL 

syntax : 
        for i in list:
            print(i) # Prints all the list element one-by-one

    -> The for loop has (start-number, end-number, step-size)
        -> Number to start with
        -> Number to end with
        -> Skip step after each number
