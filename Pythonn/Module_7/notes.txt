: FILES

    -> Python can be used to perform operations on a file (read & write data)

    Types of files :
        1. Text - Files : .docs , .txt , .log etc..
        2. Binary Files : .mp4, .mov, .png, .jpeg etc..

 
 : HOW IS THE OPERATION PERFORMED 

 1. We locate the file 
 2. We open the file / Create a file 
 3. We either Write / Read the File (r , w)
 4. We close the open / Created file 

: By default python will have read mode

SOME BASIC FILE OPERATIONS
1. 'r' -> Open for Reading (default)
2. 'w' -> Open for Writing, Truncating the file 
3. 'x' -> Create a new-file and open it for writing 
4. 'a' -> Open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
5. 'b' -> Binary Mode
6. 't' -> Text mode (default)
7. '+' -> Open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)

WHEN YOU READ THE FILE WITH THE "with" KEYWORD YOU DONT HAVE TO CLOSE THE FILE

: DELETING A FILE 

To delete a file you need to " import os "
    -> os.remove (<file-path>)

: To Replace a word or any character in a file 

    -> We need to first read the file (data) 
        -> Then replace and save to a new-variabel (new-data = data.replace('Java', 'Python'))
        -> Then Write the same file
