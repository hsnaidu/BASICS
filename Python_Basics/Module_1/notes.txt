Introduction to Python *(Guido van Rossum)

1. CODE : LANGUAGE -> PASS INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPUTER (Programming Language- > Python)

2. Takes i/p in Binary Code (Numbers : 0 or 1)
            -> 0 : Low current 
            -> 1 : High current 

3.  So, what ever we type is translated into Binary Language (0 & 1) with the help of 
    -> COMPILER / INTERPRETER
    -> CONVERT HIGH LVL LANG -TO- LOW LVL LANG

4. WHY PYTHON ? 

    -> SIMPLE & EASY (Similar to English Language)
    -> FREE & OPEN SOURCE
    -> HIGH LVL LANG
    -> PORTABLE  

5. They are used in almost Every-Domain

6. simple code : print('hello')

    -> INDENTATION IS VERY IMPORTANT IN PYTHON

7. Python can process all ASCII and Unicode (ord) characters as part of data or literals

8. VARIABLE -> THEY ARE A NAME GIVEN TO A MEMORY LOCATION IN PROGRAM 

    8.1 RULES FOR IDENTIFIER (VARIABLE NAME)
        -> YOU CAN ONLY USE A _ IN VARIABLE NAME 
        -> CANNOT USE A INT AS A VARIABLE NAME 
        -> THEY CAN BE OF ANY LENGTH

9. PYTHON HAS 5 DATATYPES
    -> INT, STRING, FLOAT, BOOLEAN, NONE
    
10. PYTHON HAS A LIST OF RSERVED WORDS, WHICH CANNOT BE USED AS A VARIABLE NAME 

11. THEY ARE CASE SENSETIVE
        -> A & a are different 

12. TYPE CONVERSION AND TYPE CASTING 

    -> Type Conversion : This is Automatically done in Python
            -> a,b = 1,2.0
            -> print(a+b) -> 3.0 (Auto. Convert to FLOAT)

    -> Type Casting : This has to be done Manually 
            -> a,b = 1,"2"
            -> print(a+b) # Error..
        
        -> Here we convert the str to int or float...
            b = int(b)
            -> print(a+b) -> 3

        -> TypeCast only works if you have a number in a string format
        -> b = "two"
        -> b = int(b) # Error..

13. type() -> function
WE CAN KNOW WHAT DATATYPE THE VARIABLE IS BY USING type()

14. TO TAKE THE INPUT FROM THE USER USE INPUT FUNCTION
        
        -> The input entered from the user is always taken in string FORMAT
    -> input() -> function

        -> To get in int() , float() formate you can use 
    -> int(input('Enter your age'))
    -> float(intput('Enter your height))

15. TERNARY OPERATOR 
    -> They are a simple if-else condition
    -> answer = "TRUE" if a < b else " FALSE"
